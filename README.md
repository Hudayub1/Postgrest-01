Practicing postgrest 

1. creating tables in and authorization in psql 
2. connecting psql using pool module, process.env is used inside
3. pool connected to queries 
4. queries connected to controller
5. controller connected to route
6. route connected to server

So far main weaknesses is in logic creation or specifically using array and object methods to make them do the things i want them to do.

My strong suit is in understanding the big picture via sequence diagrams

will continue and practice a lot by building more fullstack app/web, mostly will try building small features first
